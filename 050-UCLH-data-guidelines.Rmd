## Five Safes at UCLH overview

Data access at UCLH is judged using the '[5
safes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mln9T52mwj0)'
framework. This summarises our local implementation.

**Safe people**

-   all individuals have substantive contracts or educational
    relationships with higher education or NHS institutions

-   those working need to have evidence of experience of working with
    such data (e.g. previous training, previous work with ONS, data safe
    havens etc.) or they need a supervisor who can has similar
    experience

-   those working need to undergo training in information governance and
    issues with statistical disclosure control (SDC)

**Safe projects**

-   projects must serve the public good

-   projects must meet relevant HRA and UCLH research and ethics
    approvals

-   service delivery work mandated as per usual trust processes

**Safe settings**

-   working at UCLH in the NHS on approved infrastructure

-   UCLH local and remote desktops

-   UCLH Data Science Desktop

-   EMAP

**Safe outputs**

-   outputs (e.g. reports, figures and tables) must be non-disclosing

-   outputs should remain on NHS systems initially

-   a copy of all outputs that are released externally (documents)
    should be stored in one central location so that there is visibility
    for all

**Safe data**

-   direct identifiers (hospital numbers, NHS numbers, names etc) should
    be masked unless there is an explicit justification for their use

-   data releases are proportionate (e.g. limited by calendar periods,
    by patient cohort etc.)

-   further work to obscure or mask the data is not necessary given the
    other safe guards (as per the recommendation by the UK data service)
   
We will now give more details for each of the 5 safes.   
    
## Safe people

We suggest you measure yourself against the following criteria.

## Safe projects

We have adopted and adapted the ONS Data Ethics Advisory Committee's application form.

<!-- note link to appliaction form from earlier version is no longer working -->
<!-- [application
form](https://www.statisticsauthority.gov.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/DEA_Research_Project_Application_v1.2.docx)  -->

Where you have an existing IRAS form, we have indicated the sections
that can be directly copy-and-pasted into this application.


The UCLH version [can be downloaded here](https://github.com/uclh-criu/uclh-data-training/blob/master/guides/five-safes/criu-research-project-application.docx).


The project application headings are summarised below

1.  **Application Type: Research or Exploratory analysis**
    *Most applications will require formal research approval, but there
    are circumstances where the work will be exploratory. This will need
    to be justified to the UCLH data access committee.*

2.  **Project Lead**
    *Name and details with comment on whether the lead will also view
    the data or just the derived outputs*

3.  **Researcher Team**
    *Name and details of all members plus guidance as to whom the
    project lead is deputising*

4.  **Research Sponsor**
    *Have you been commissioned to perform this research for another
    organisation?*

5.  **Title of the research project**
    And estimated duration of the project

6.  **Abstract of the research project**
    *Include a short description of the project and its benefits, in no
    more than 100 words.*
    *or* IRAS Section A6-1 "Summary of the study" (300 words)

7.  **Purpose of Research Project**
    *Provide a detailed description of the purpose for which the data
    are requested, describing the aims of the study/research in no more
    than 500 words. Where research is part of a larger programme please
    include details below.*
    *or* IRAS Section A12. "What is the scientific justification for the
    research?"

8.  **Research Methodology**
    *Provide details of the research protocol or methodology (e.g. data
    linkage or matching, statistical modelling etc) and how you intend
    to use the data, in no more than 1000 words.*
    *or* IRAS Section A13. "Please give a full summary of your design
    and methodology"

9.  **Data Required**

    1.  *List the data sources, the patient cohorts and the timer
        periods you wish to examine. Give as much detail as possible on
        the exact data items you require.*

    2.  *Describe what portions of the data **will** be or **might** be
        identifiable using the framework below. For example, you might
        require hospital number to link to other data items (a direct
        identifier). However, you might also require date of birth to
        define age, this might be an identifying with other
        information.*

        1.  **Direct identifiers**
            e.g. names, NHS number, hospital number etc.

        2.  **Indirect identifiers**
            e.g. date of birth, diagnosis, the first 3 letters of a
            postcode etc.

        3.  **Non-identifying variables**
            e.g. heart rate, creatinine, urine volume

        4.  **Free text**
            Where under normal circumstances de-identification is not
            guaranteed

    3.  Other data sources
        *If you intend to bring in any data for your project, give
        details of the data including who the owner is and provide
        evidence that the owner has given permission for their data to
        be used by you for this research.*

    4.  Justification for access to this rather than existing or public
        data
        *Explain why access to legally protected (unpublished) data is
        needed. Please state what other data sources have been

## Safe settings

You should confirm that you are working at UCLH on approved
infrastructure. For example,

-   UCLH local and remote desktops

-   **or** UCLH Data Science Desktop

-   **or** a Generic Application Environment provisioned through EMAP    


## Safe outputs

You should confirm that

-   outputs must be non-disclosing

-   outputs must remain on UCLH systems until suitable publication
    clearance can be demonstrated

-   outputs will be archived as per any internal processes mandated by
    any of UCLH Information Services, Clinical Research Informatics Unit
    or the UCL/UCLH Joint Research Office

Outputs include

-   manuscripts or reports containing prose, tables and figures

-   software applications

-   statistical models (e.g. machine learning, artificial intelligence
    or similar)

-   data (electronic or otherwise)


## Safe data

You are expected to explain in your **Safe projects** application :

-   any requirement for access to

    -   direct or indirect identifiers otherwise a **pseudonymised
        identifier** will be provided

    -   sensitive information (e.g. HIV status, drug and alcohol
        history, mental health history etc.)

-   how your data request is proportionate. We suggest you provide clear
    limits by

    -   calendar period

    -   patient cohort

    -   data content

Further work to obscure or mask the data should not be necessary given
the other safeguards.
