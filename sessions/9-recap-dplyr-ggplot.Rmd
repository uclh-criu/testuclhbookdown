## Objectives

**Overall : recap data manipulation & plotting in R**

1. [repeat from last session] get most recent ‘uclh-data-training’ project from Github into RStudio

2. create new RStudio project for own work

3. recap dplyr (data manipulation) & ggplot2 (plotting)



## recap dplyr (data manipulation) & ggplot2 (plotting)

We introduced the packages dplyr & ggplot2 in the first R course.

Here is a quick reminder of some important dplyr if you haven't had a chance to use much.

dplyr & ggplot2 packages both part of the tidyverse, 
`library(tidyverse)`

In tidy data, columns are variables & rows are observations


### dplyr

The 4 main commands :

    `select()` picks variables (COLUMNS) based on their names.   
    `filter()` picks cases (ROWS) based on their values.   
    `summarise()` reduces multiple values down to a single summary.   
    `group_by()` allows you to perform operations “by group” particularly summarise.   


`%>%` the pipe, passes the result of one function to another   

Some examples from the R course :   

Filter rows by age, then selecting just a single column.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cchic %>%
  filter(age_years >= 65) %>%
  select(sex)
```

Grouping to calculate a summary.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
cchic %>%
  group_by(sex) %>%
  summarise(mean_urea = mean(urea, na.rm=TRUE))
```

### ggplot2

```
ggplot(DATA) + GEOM(aes(x=COLUMN to set aesthetics))
```

example from the R course

```{r, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(cchic) +
  geom_point(aes(x=age_years, y=weight, colour=sex))
```


Now have a look at this file in the RStudio project : 
`database-use/03-manipulate-plot-query-results.R`

It uses dplyr & ggplot2 on the decovid omop data.
