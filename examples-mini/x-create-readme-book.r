# x-create-readme.r

### script to create the readme file for the mini examples

# aims to make the examples self-documenting
# i.e. the comments in the files are used to create the documentation
# reduces risk that code & docs diverge
# to work it needs the 2nd non empty line of the scripts to contain the description 
# this script doesn't use the first line of each file - gets name from the filename
# again reduces risk that filenames & docs diverge
# ** later I could add numbering by just adding numbering into filenames e.g. 01-filename.r
# ** that would also make it easy to change order

# uses R to list files, read each mini example and write two lines for each into the readme 
# I might be able to tweak this to add a links to the files, but would only work from github
