# Welcome to the UCLH Data Science Fellows program {-}

The [UCLH data training repository](https://github.com/uclh-criu/uclh-data-training) contains training materials introducing R for the manipulation and visualisation of patient data in UCLH. It assumes no knowledge of R, but is structured so that those who know some R can also benefit. It starts with a two day course and provides materials to take things further. 

These resources are part of a UCLH fellowship program developing the capacity of clinicians to use R and other modern data tools to manipulate hospital generated data. In the longer term the aim is to help clinicians develop modern, reproducible data workflows – ‘good enough’ scientific computing - to make their work more efficient. We will be working to improve the interfaces between these practices and the hospital data systems.
